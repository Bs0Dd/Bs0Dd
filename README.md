### Hi there! 

I'm **Bs0Dd** - expert in **useless** software making, hah.

I'm writing on Lua, C/C++ (sometimes with Qt) and Intel 8080A assembly (very rarely).  
Early coded on Python with PyQt.

There are some useless (and maybe some useful) projects:

* [**Coverett**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/Coverett) - C library for interacting with HLAPI devices of the OpenComputers II mod.

* [**OpenCompSoft**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/OpenCompSoft) - Lua software for OpenComputers mod.

* [**OpenCompSoft2**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/OpenCompSoft2) - some software for OpenComputers2.

* [**GRIDISKCOM**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/GRiDISKCOM) - Simple two-panel file manager for GRiD OS disk images.

* [**HELLSMI**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/HELLSMI) - esoteric and useless language, yeah.

* [**brainfuck-86rk**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/brainfuck-86rk) - Brainfuck interpreter for Radio-86RK soviet computer. Written on Intel 8080A assembly))0)0))).

* [**KunAPIPy**](https://github.com/Bs0Dd/KunAPIPy) - simple wrapper for Kundelik.kz service. It's no longer being developed for the reason of stopping working with Python.


I contributed to:

* [**MineOS**](https://github.com/IgorTimofeev/MineOS) - Picture View, Calendar, some additional functional for Picture Edit, Image and Screen libraries.

* [**CCOS-disk-utils**](https://github.com/BOOtak/CCOS-disk-utils) - some functions and bugfixes for library.
