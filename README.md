### Hi there! 

I'm a **Bs0Dd** - expert in **useless** software making, hah.

I'm writing on Lua, C/C++ (sometimes with Qt) and Intel 8080A assembly (very rarely).  
Early coded on Python with PyQt.

There are some useless (and maybe some useful) projects:
* KunAPIPy - simple wrapper for Kundelik.kz service. It's no longer being developed for the reason of stopping working with Python.

* HELLSMI - esoteric and useless language, yeah.

* brainfuck-86rk - Brainfuck interpreter for Radio-86RK soviet computer. Written on Intel 8080A assembly))0)0))).

* OpenCompSoft - Lua software for OpenComputers mod.

* OpenCompSoft2 - some software for OpenComputers2.

* GRIDISKCOM - Simple two-panel file manager for GRiD OS disk images.


I contributed to:

* MineOS - Picture View, Calendar, some additional functional for Picture Edit, Image and Screen libraries.

* CCOS-disk-utils - some functions and bugfixes for library.
